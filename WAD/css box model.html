	It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar
	 or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as 
	strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base 
	and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to 
	stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred
	to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. 
	The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures 
	(below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</font></p>
